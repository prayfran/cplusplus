This is a lab about linked lists.

-  Compile & link main.cc & ll.cc together.

-  Create a Makefile so that you won't have to type g++ again.

-  Run the resultant executable; observe how the program works.
   Reading the code may help.

-  Are there any memory leaks?  If so, fix them.

-  Find uses of "this->", which are always suspicious.  Remove them.
   Does everything still work?

-  Methods named Initialize() sometimes indicate that the author
   of the code doesn't understand constructors.  Turn them into ctors.

-  Are your ctors using member initialization lists?  Make them do so.

-  The method Delete() uses a pointer argument to return a value.
   How crass--use a reference, instead.

-  Add a method Print() that displays the list.  Add another case in main()
   that uses it.

For extra fame & glory:

-  Are you SURE that you have no memory leaks?  What happens when
   a LinkedList object is destroyed?  Fix that.

-  Using Print() is tacky.  Overload the << operator so that you can use << 
   on a LinkedList object, just like any other type.
